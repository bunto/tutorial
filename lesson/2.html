<p>The Bunto gem makes a bunto executable available to you in your Terminal window. You can use this command in a number of ways:</p>

<pre>
$ bunto build
# => The current folder will be generated into ./_site

$ bunto build --destination <destination>
# => The current folder will be generated into <destination>

$ bunto build --source <source> --destination <destination>
# => The <source> folder will be generated into <destination>

$ bunto build --watch
# => The current folder will be generated into ./_site,
#    watched for changes, and regenerated automatically.
</pre>

<p>Bunto also comes with a built-in development server that will allow you to preview what the generated site will look like in your browser locally.</p>

<pre>
$ bunto serve
# => A development server will run at http://localhost:4000/
# Auto-regeneration: enabled. Use `--no-watch` to disable.

$ bunto serve --detach
# => Same as `bunto serve` but will detach from the current terminal.
#    If you need to kill the server, you can `kill -9 1234` where "1234" is the PID.
#    If you cannot find the PID, then do, `ps aux | grep bunto` and kill the instance. [Read more](http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/shell/jobz5.html).
