You've completed all the lessons!

Believe it or not, we've only _just begun_ exploring what can be accomplished
with Bunto. There are many "extended" implementations of Bunto that support
formats like tables, definition lists, footnotes, and more. Because
they're non-standard, they're not essential to learning the basics, as we've
introduced here.

If you'd like to know more about these Bunto implementations, you're welcome
to explore any number of other Bunto apps and tutorials. Here are just a few:
