[Bunto][bunto] is a Web Application Framework which can be used as a simple, 
static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites. 

Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. 
Bunto takes your content, renders HTML and CSS templates, and spits 
out a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache, hostSE, 
Nginx or another web server. Bunto is the engine behind GitHub Pages, 
which you can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories.

[Philosophy][philosophy]: Bunto does what you tell it to do â€” no more, no less. 
It doesn't try to outsmart users by making bold assumptions, nor does 
it burden them with needless complexity and configuration. Put simply, 
Bunto gets out of your way and allows you to concentrate on what truly 
matters: your content.

If you have ten minutes, you can learn to use Bunto!

In each lesson, you'll be given an introduction to a single Bunto
concept. Then, you'll be asked to complete several exercises with that
new knowledge.
